    <h2>Luis Felipe Reis</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Luis Felipe. I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I work with international logistics but I want to change my career and that is why I am pursuing certificates in computer programming and web development.
        BYU is amazing and I enjoy to learn secular subjects at the same time I can learn things from the gospel. The opportunity to meet people from around the world is amazing too!</p>
    <p>I love all kind of sports and outdoor activities. I also love music and I can play some musical instruments.</p>
        My family and I have been members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 18 years. I am single and I do not have children.
    <p>I am very excited to learn more and get to know new people this semester! We can do it!</p>
